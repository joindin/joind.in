There is no requirement to support another language, the code is PHP therefore easy for PHP programmers to work with and the license is commercially friendly.

Cette session se propose d\'explorer certaines des possibilités méconnues de ce langage objet qui est en passe de devenir indispensable. Plus particulièrement, on s\'intéresse aux idiomes \"fonctionnels\" que Javascript offre et qui permettent de produire du code très expressif et compact en composant, enchaînant et manipulant des fonctions (et des objets !). Ces idées seront illustrées sous la forme d\'un \"kata\" de programmation dont l\'objectif sera de développer un mini-langage de validation de données, sur la base de l\'API jQuery de manipulation du DOM.

Documentation is nice (and essential) but there\'s no substitute for relying on the code itself as the canonical source for information about, well, the code. That\'s where static and dynamic analysis come in. Static analysis is scanning, parsing, munching, and otherwise processing our PHP source code to answer whatever questions we have about it. Who calls this function? What parts of the code do disk write operations? Are there any untranslated strings in our localization message catalogs? Dynamic analysis gathers information from running code. How many times is a function called? How long does it take? When does our PHP code access the filesystem?
