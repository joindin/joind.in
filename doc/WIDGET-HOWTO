Using the widgets:
----------------------------

The Joind.in widgets are all javascript based and can be called by including the main
javascript widget file - widget.js - and calling various functions. Below you'll find
an example of an HTML page that uses a widget:

<html>
	<head>
		<title>Widget Test Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="http://joind.in/inc/js/widget.js" id="joindin_widget"></script>
		<script>
			joindin.display_vote_small(175);
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

This example loads one of the feedback widgets for the talk #175. When the page loads, 
you'll see a "vote" button that, when clicked, will expand out into the full voting widget.

As an optional argument to all of the widget functions, you can also provide the ID of
an element you want to inject the widget into.
