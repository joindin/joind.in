Joind.in provides the missing link between the people attending a conference and the ones that presented. 
The usual method of handing out paper forms is outdated and needs to be replaced. That's where we come in - 
attendees can post their comments directly to each of the talks they attended, giving the speaker direct feedback
on how they did and what they can do to improve.

<p>
Joind.in also has something to offer the speakers - you can track your record across the conferences and see
how changes in your talk might have made a difference in your ratings.
