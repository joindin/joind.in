<p><strong>Q: So, why open source the system?</strong><br>
A: It’s simple really – not only did the idea evolve out of a community (the <span class="caps">PHP</span> community is awesome, by the way) but it’s also a perfect project to get out there and let other communities use. The whole point of the site is to get people talking to each other and sharing the code for the site is a great way to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you choose CodeIgniter over something like the Zend Framework (or one of tons of others out there)?</strong><br>
A: CodeIgniter was selected for two reasons – it’s simple nature and how this nature makes it easier for other developers to get in on the process. The learning curve for CodeIgniter is pretty flat – even people without much experience in <span class="caps">MVC</span> frameworks can pick it up in no time. There’s been a few challenges along the way that other frameworks might have made easier, but nothing that hasn’t been overcome.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How can I help?</strong><br>
A: If you’re looking to get into helping with the source, getting started is simple! Once you’ve pulled down the source from github and configured it (look in the “doc” directory for the <span class="caps">README</span>) for your local environment you can go one of two ways – you can either just start poking around the code and start adding and fixing or, if you’re looking for things to directly help with, check out our <a href="http://joindin.jira.com" class="classname" title="title tooltip">Issues List</a></p>
<p><strong>Q: What coding standard is used?</strong><br>
A: We are in the process of converting our code to the <span class="caps">PEAR</span> Coding Standard (<a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php">http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php</a>). This is a widely adopted standard which is supported by many tools and IDEs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where can I get involved?</strong><br>
A: We have a few places you can get involved and see what’s going on with the projects. There’s three mailing lists for different aspects of the site: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/joindin-developers">joindin-developers</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/joindin-announce">joindin-announce</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/joindin-features">joindin-features</a>, There’s also an <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel on the <strong>Freenode.net</strong> network where other developers come to talk – <strong>#joind.in</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who can I contact if I have more direct questions about the code/site?</strong><br>
A: You can always send a note to <a href="mailto:info@joind.in" class="classname" title="title tooltip">feedback@joind.in</a> with any kind of questions you might have about the source, the project or how you can use it for you or your organization.</p>
