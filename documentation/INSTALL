INSTALL

 1: Get the latest version
 2: Create a database
 3: Update configuration
 4: Create necessary directories
 5: Setup a virtual host

== 1: Get the latest version ==

Checkout the latest version from our SVN repository.
  
  svn co svn://joind.in/var/cache/svn/confs/trunk joind.in

This will create a directory called joind.in with the latest version of the 
trunk in it.

== 2: Create a database ==



== 3: Update configuration ==
Configuration files are not committed to the repository, these need to be edited 
manually.

First, copy ''system/application/config/config.php.dist'' to 
''system/application/config/config.php''. Open the file and edit the 
$config['base_url'] value to the url you're developing on. Then go to the bottom 
of the file and change the $config['mail_admin'] value to your email address.

Second, the database needs to be configured. Copy the file 
''system/application/config/database.php.dist'' to 
''system/application/config/database.php. Edit the file and enter the correct 
url and credentials to the joind.in database we installed in the previous section.

== 4: Create necessary directories ==

Joind.in needs a directory to store temporary identification tokens in. Create 
the directory ''system/cache/ctokens'' and make sure it is writable for the 
webserver. 

Then there are two directories that are used to upload event icons and speaker 
pictures. Make sure the directories ''inc/img/event_icons'' and 
''inc/img/speaker_pictures'' exist and are writable for the webserver.

== 5: Setup a virtual host ==
Create a virtual host in your apache configuration (e.g. local.joind.in). Make 
sure your hosts file points the url ''local.joind.in'' to your development server.
