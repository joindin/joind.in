<h2>Talk Administration</h2>

<h3>Working with Your Talk</h3>
<p>
Whether you're an event admin or just a speaker who has had their talk claim approved, there are a few things you need
to know about editing the details of your talk. You can get to the session's management by visiting the sesssion's page
and clicking on the <b>Edit Talk</b> button just below the details.
</p>

<h3>What's on the Form</h3>
<p>
Most of the fields are pretty obvious in what they do, but here's a quick rundown on some things you might not know:
<ul>
<li><b>Date and Time of Session</b><br/>The date/time of the session cannot be outside of the time of the event. If you try to change it outside of that,
you'll get an error.
<li><b>Session Type</b><br/>You can change the session type if it's not correct (<a href="/help/user_guide_talks">see here</a> for more on session
types).
<li><b>Session Language:</b><br/>You can update the language to the correct one for your talk
<li><b>Slides Link</b><br/>This is where you can specify the link to your presentation. By default it's empty so nothing will
show on the talk's detail page. If this value is filled in, though, the link will automatically populate on the talk's details
with the URL given.
</ul>
