This is the second generation API for joind.in.

To configure:
 - point a new virtual host at the public directory, one level below this file.
 - symlink database.php in /src/api-v2/ to the database.php in your joind.in installation.
 - mbstring extension is required.

 Examples:
 GET /v2/events
 GET /v2/events/23
 GET /v2/events/23
 GET /v2/events/15/comment
 GET /v2/events/15/talk

 Supported URL parameters:
 verbose=yes (gives more fields in the response)
 start (a number, used for pagination.  Resultset will start this many records into the set, defaults to 0)
 resultsperpage (a number, used for pagination. Defaults to 20, if 0 is passed, all results are returned)

To add credentials for a new consumer:
 - run scripts/generateNewKeys.php (taken entirely from http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/55-Writing-an-OAuth-Provider-Service.html)
 - run the resulting SQL against the database
 - give consumer key and secret to new consumer, and ask them not to check the secret into source control
