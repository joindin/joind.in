#####################

This is the source code for the Joind.in website - a resource set up to allow
events to get real-time feedback from those attending. It also gives speakers a 
way to claim and track their presentations over time.

There's a few SQL files that are included with the source to help you get things 
up and running. The first four will bring your database to the most current, up-to-date
status and ALL should be run for a new install:
	-----------------------
	-> doc/db/init_db.sql
		Export of the initial data structure, ready for
		import (as exported from MySQL)
		
	-> doc/db/init_data.sql
		This file contains a few handy things for your database's initial setup
		like languages and session categories
		
	-> doc/db/patch*.sql
		Numbered patch files to run in order after running init_db.  All database changes to be
		managed using these, init_db does NOT get updated.  For more information on this approach,
		see http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2010/Simple-Database-Patching-Strategy. If patch 17
		fails it can be skipped.
		
	-> doc/db/seed_countries.sql
		Some seed data for the countries table (needed for timezone selection)
	-----------------------
	
This last SQL file will give you a jumping off point to see how the system works. It will 
populate your system with some seed data (talks, users, events) so you can see how they all 
relate:
	-----------------------
	-> doc/db/seed.sql
		Some seed data you can load into your (MySQL) database to get the ball rolling
	-----------------------	

Finally, there's some other scripts that come with the source to make things easier to setup.
	- Release of CodeIgniter
	- Sample cron jobs (in /src/scripts)

Installation
#####################
The following are the steps you'll need to correctly install the software:

- Download/clone the current repository and drop it into a 
	web-accessible directory for your server

- Set the document root to the /src directory

- In the /src/system/cache directory, create a web server-writeable 
	directory called "ctokens"

- In the /src/inc/img directory, create a web server writable directory
    called "user_gravatar"
	
- In your src/system/application/config directory:
	> Make a database.php file using the database.php.dist as a guide
	> Make a config.php file using the config.php.dist as a guide
	
- Push the doc/db/init_db.sql file into your database

- Apply any of the other patches in the /db folder

If you'd like some seed data, you can use the seed.sql to load in a few events, 
users and talks. You'll also need to load in the seed_countries.sql file to
get the complete list of countries for the event details.

The default password for users is "password"


Extensions
###################
In order to run tests make sure you have the following extensions installed and
configured. This library can be ignored if you are not planning on running
tests.
- pecl_http
  $ pecl install pecl_http
  
  in php.ini add:
  > linux: extension=http.so
  > windows: extension=http.dll

Debugging
#############
By default the application is in production mode. This primarily means that
error messages and notices are suppressed.

To allow errors and notices to be shown on the site you have to change the
environment variable JOINDIN_DEBUG to the value 'on'. It is discouraged to
do this on production environments as this will allow visitors to see any
errors produced by the site.

The JOINDIN_DEBUG environment variable is controlled from the accompanying
.htaccess file.

Tests
#############

There are some tests set up, which use PHPUnit; these can be found in the
src/tests directory.  There is an ant task configured to run them - from the
root directory simply run "ant phpunit" to run the tests.

Note 1: The API tests actually call the service externally and rely on pecl_http
being installed to run.
